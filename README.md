qGo
===

### Revised qGo to be successfully compiled on CentOS 7.

### This is a only copy of IGS client that I can find to make it work on CentOS 7.

### Some simple fixes to make the code work on CentOS 7, including:

1. rename <iostream.h> to <iostream>, and corresponding std:: revises.

2. Some class contructors without class name as prefix.
